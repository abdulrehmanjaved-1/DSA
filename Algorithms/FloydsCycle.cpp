//TODO: find the cycle present or not in linkedList (ie: this is circular or not),also find the first node of the cycle,
//then remove the cycle ...simply by pointing that to NULL.
//--> hints: Point of interaction by slow and fast approach... and for finding out the starting of loop use point slow to start again method and 
//continue POI and slow with same pace now and find where they meet as : A+B=x*C;
