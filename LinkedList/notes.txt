linked list is a linear data structure with many nodes.
each node contains data and address of next node data...
insertion and deletion is easy in linked list without wastage of space and time...
we can grow/shrink it on run time...

->type:
*singly*doubly*circular*circular doubly.

    For insertion see singlyLinkedList.cpp.(we actually change pointer and data to pint to next or prev or that number)
